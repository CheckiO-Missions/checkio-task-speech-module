    Stephen's speech module is broken.
    This module is responsible for his number pronunciation.
    He has to click to input all of the numerical digits in a figure,
    so when there are big numbers it can take him a long time.
    Help the robot to speak properly and increase his number processing speed by writing a new speech module for him.
    All the words in the string must be separated by exactly one space character.
    Be careful with spaces - it's hard to see if you place two spaces instead one.

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    This concept may be useful for the speech synthesis software or automatic reports systems.
    This system can also be used when writing a chatbot by assigning words or phrases numerical
    values and having a system retrieve responses based on those values.
