            💡 The solution I offer you is the following.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        First, to make such changes in the initial lists, that each word responds to its index. Its make the further expressions more readable. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Second, to break the initial number into a list/tuple of integers, complemented with zeros to the length of three (the maximum length of the number in this mission).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Third, to create new list with words from the initial lists instead of respective digits from "broken" number (taking into considerations the specific case with the second tenth - 10-19).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        And the last, join this list of words (without empty elements) into the string with whitespaces and return it.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>Ok, what should I start from?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Let's add to the initial lists empty elements at beginning, so the words become corresponding to its indexes. Also remove <b class="code">HUNDRED</b> - you will write word <b class="code">"hundred"</b> ones in the solution. I also make tuples from the lists, but it does not matter - you may keep them as lists.

            Explain to me, how to convert number into the tuple of integers.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You should start with converting the number into string with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_str.asp">str()</a> built-in function.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
str(num)
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now, complement the string with zeros to the length of three. It makes further expressions simpler and more readable. Do it with string method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_zfill.asp">str.zfill(int)</a>.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
str(num).zfill(3)
        </pre>
        <p>
            Split the string and convert each character in integer with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_map.asp">map()</a> built-in function.
            It return <b class="code">map</b> object.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
map(int, str(num).zfill(3))
        </pre>
        <p>
            It will be useful later, if unpack this object into tuple <b class="code">h, t, o</b> - hundreds, tenth, ones respectively. Since the length of the string after complementing with zeros will always be 3, you will always have hundreds and tenth, even if their values will remain zeros. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
h, t, o = map(int, str(num).zfill(3))

        <p>
            That was detailed! Now help me to build the new list with words instead of digits.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Let's declare the new variable <b class="code">res</b> as a tuple of words for your "hundreds" digit. You just need to use <b class="code">h</b> variable as index of element <b class="code">FIRST_TEN</b> tuple, since hundreds counting is the same as ones counting - one (hundred), two (hundred) etc. If <b class="code">h</b> equals <b class="code">0</b> empty string is got from tuple.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
res = FIRST_TEN[h], ...
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now you need to add word <b class="code">"hundred"</b>, which is needed only if <b class="code">h</b> (number of hundreds) not equal <b class="code">0</b>. Use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp">bool()</a> function to perform the checking.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
res = FIRST_TEN[h], "hundred"*bool(h)
        </pre>
        <p>
            If <b class="code">h</b> is equal <b class="code">0</b>, this element of tuple would be empty string.

        <p>
            How to complement the tuple with tenth and ones?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Basically, doing the same, as in previous step with hundreds. If the value of tenth <b class="code">t</b> equals <b class="code">1</b>, it means you have deal with the second ten - ten, eleven, twelve etc. In this case, you should use the values of ones <b class="code">o</b> variable as an index for element in <b class="code">SECOND_TEN</b> tuple. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
res += (SECOND_TEN[o],) if t == 1 else ...
        </pre>
        <p>
            Remember, that <b class="code">res</b> is a tuple, so you need to add the tenth word as an element of tuple. That is why the above expressions may look weird. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In other case, when <b class="code">t</b> is not equal <b class="code">1</b>, you just add a tuple with two respective words for <b class="code">t</b> and <b class="code">o</b> indexes from <b class="code">OTHER_TENS</b> and <b class="code">FIRST_TEN</b> tuples.  
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
res += (SECOND_TEN[o],) if t == 1 else (OTHER_TENS[t], FIRST_TEN[o])

    <div class="question">
        <p>
            The tuple is built. But how to convert it in the correct line of words?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Remove all empty strings (absent hundreds, tenth, ones) from the tuple with built-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_filter.asp">filter()</a> function and <b class="code">bool</b> function as filtering rule.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
filter(bool, res)
        </pre>
        <p>
            Use the result of filtering as an argument for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp">str.join(iterable)</a> method. Join the words using whitespaces. 
        </p>

        <p>
            You just need to add final expressions from previous hints, wrap your code into function expression and return the joined string.
